The following parameters were used in Gephi to visualize our graphs.

CaseStudy1
Based on the Gephi graph KingsQueens_w10_severalIstar in RoyalAndDeity.gephi
Node size: weighted degree 15-50
Label size fixed, Arial Bold 28
The Queens and Kings nodes were settled in the graph in the following positions (x,y): Queens (-750, 0), Kings (750, 0).
Other nodes were allowed to move freely in the graph.
We first applied the ForceAtlas 2 layout algorithm with the following parameters:
- Scaling 1.0
- Gravity 0.1
- LinLog mode off
- Prevent overlap off
- Edge weight influence 1.0
Afterwards, we applied the LabelAdjust layout algorithm

CaseStudy2
Based on the Gephi graph Royalty_Deities_w10_severalIstar in RoyalAndDeity.gephi
Node size: weighted degree 15-50
Label size fixed, Arial Bold 28
The nodes of Sargon, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal, and Naqi'a were settled in the graph in the following positions (x,y):
- Sargon_Senn_Esarh_Ash: Sargon (-600, 0), Sennacherib (0, 600), Esarhaddon (0, -600), Ashurbanipal (600, 0)
- Senn_Esarh_Ash_Naqia: Sennacherib (-600, 0), Esarhaddon (0, -600), Ashurbanipal (600, 0), Naqi'a (0, 600)
- Sargon_Senn_Esarh_Ash_Naqia: calculated using https://www.geogebra.org/m/qBfHYSTQ and multiplying the coordinates between 0-1 by 600: Ashurbanipal (0 degrees) 1,0 = 600,0; Naqi'a (72 degrees) 0.31,0.95 = 186,570; Sargon (144 degrees) -0.81,0.59 = -486,354; Sennacherib (216 degrees) -0.81,-0.59 = -486,-354; Esarhaddon (288 degrees) 0.31,-0.95 = 186,-570.
Other nodes were allowed to move freely in the graph.

CaseStudy3
Based on the Gephi graph Royalty_Deities_w10_severalIstar in RoyalAndDeity.gephi
Node size: 10
Label size fixed, Arial Bold 28
The nodes of all kings and queens were settled in the graph and positioned on the semicircle. Their positions were calculated using https://www.geogebra.org/m/qBfHYSTQ. 
Kings: 17 nodes with 16 sectors of 11.25 degrees in between them. The coordinates between 0 and 1 were multiplied by 1000. Queens: 7 nodes with 6 sectors of 30 degrees in between them. The coordinates between 0 and 1 were multiplied by 500.
Other nodes were allowed to move freely in the graph.
We first applied the ForceAtlas 2 layout algorithm with the following parameters:
- Scaling 0.01
- Gravity 0.05
- LinLog mode off
- Prevent overlap off
- Edge weight influence 1.0
Afterwards, we applied the LabelAdjust layout algorithm
