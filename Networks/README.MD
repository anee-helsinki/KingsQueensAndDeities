## Network files and related data

See the folder Visualizations for pdf images of our networks.

<b>EgoNetworks:</b> Ego networks of individual kings and queens, both as pdf visualizations and Gephi projects.

<b>Gephi_Log.txt:</b> Gives the parameters we used in Gephi to visualize our graphs.

<b>Graphs1-4.gephi:</b> Networks which were created from KingsAndQueens.gexf and RoyalAndDeities.gexf and analyzed in the case studies of the article. These graphs are available in the pdf format in the folder Visualizations.

<b>Graphs2-3_edge_weights.csv/.pdf:</b> A comparison chart of edge weights between the five royal persons and deities in Graphs 2 and 3.

<b>Kings_edges.csv:</b> Edge weights between the kings' node and deities in descending order (Graph 1).

<b>NodeCodes.csv:</b> The codes given to kings (k), queens (q), gods (m), goddesses (f), and groups of deities (g). These codes are used for coloring the different types of nodes with different colors in Gephi graphs.

<b>Queens_edges.csv:</b> Edge weights between the queens' node and deities in descending order (Graph 1).

<b>TestingWindowSize.gephi:</b> Networks used for testing window sizes of 5, 10, and 15 words with Pmizer.

The gexf files used to create the graphs in Gephi:
- <b>RoyalAndDeities.gexf:</b> individual kings and queens connected to deities.
- <b>NotNormalised.gexf:</b> RoyalAndDeities.gexf without normalizing the edge weights.
- <b>KingsAndQueens.gexf:</b> individual kings and queens collapsed to one node each and connected to deities.
