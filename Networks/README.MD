## Graphs and the data used to create them

See the folder Visualization for pdf images of our networks.

The gexf files used to create the graphs in Gephi:
- <b>RoyalAndDeities.gexf</b> with kings, queens, and deities.
- <b>KingsAndQueens.gexf</b> with all kings and all Queens combined to *Kings* and *Queens* respectively.
- <b>notNormalised.gexf</b> with kings, queens, and deities without normalising the weights.

<b>KingsDeities_noNormalization.gephi: </b> Gephi project with non-normalized graphs of kings and deities, using window sizes of 5, 10, and 15 words.

<b>NodeCodes.txt:</b> The codes given to kings (k), queens (q), gods (m), goddesses (f), groups of deities (g), and unknown (u). These codes are used for colouring the different types with different colours in Gephi graphs.

<b>RoyalAndDeities_noNormalization.gephi: </b> Gephi project with a non-normalized full graph of queens, kings, and deities.

<b>RoyalAndDeity.gephi:</b> Gephi project with the normalized graphs from which the graphs in CaseStudy1/2/3.gephi were created.

<b>Graphs1-4.gephi:</b> Networks which were created from KingsAndQueens.gexf and RoyalAndDeities.gexf and analyzed in the case studies of the article. These graphs are available in the pdf format in the folder Visualizations.

<b>Gephi_Log.txt:</b> Gives the parameters we used in Gephi to visualize our graphs.

<b>TestingWindowSize.gephi:</b> Networks used for testing window sizes 5, 10, and 15 when using Pmizer.
