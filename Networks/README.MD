## Graphs and the data used to create them

See the folder Visualization for pdf images of our networks.

The gexf files used to create the graphs in Gephi:

<b>RoyalAndDeities.gexf</b> with kings, queens, and deities.
<b>KingsAndQueens.gexf</b> with all kings and all Queens combined to *Kings* and *Queens* respectively.
<b>notNormalised.gexf</b> with kings, queens, and deities without normalising the weights.

<b>KingsDeities_noNormalization.gephi: </b> Gephi project with non-normalized graphs of kings and deities, using window sizes of 5, 10, and 15 words.

<b>RoyalAndDeities_noNormalization.gephi: </b> Gephi project with a non-normalized full graph of queens, kings, and deities.

<b>RoyalAndDeity.gephi:</b> Gephi project with the normalized graphs from which the graphs in CaseStudy1/2/3.gephi were created.

<b>CaseStudy1/2/3.gephi:</b> Networks which were created from RoyalAndDeity.gephi and analyzed in the case studies of the article. These graphs are available in the pdf format in the folder Visualizations.

<b>Case_Studies_Log.txt:</b> Gives the parameters we used in Gephi to visualize our graphs.
