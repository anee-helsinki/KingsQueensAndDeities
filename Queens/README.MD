## Data used to create network between queens and deities

<b>QueenTextsOracc.csv</b> A list of texts in Oracc (RIAo, RINAP, SAAo) which include at least one queen and one deity. In case of unnamed queens, we followed Svärd 2015 and included all the identifications she characterizes as certain or probable. Those identifications which Svärd classifies “possible” and those in which she lists several possible queens were left out.

<b>Queens-deities_forSNA.csv:</b> A listing of queens and the deities mentioned in the same text. 

<b>queens_severalIstar.csv:</b> A list of pairs of queens and deities with the number of times they were mentioned together in all the texts studies. 

<b>texts_queens:</b> A list of the texts used.
