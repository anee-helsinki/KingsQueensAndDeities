## Data used for creating networks between queens and deities

<b>Co-occurrences_Queens_Deities.csv:</b> A list of pairs of queens and deities with the number of times they co-occur in Texts_Queens_Deities.csv.

<b>Frequencies_Deities_Q.tsv:</b> List of deities and their frequencies in Texts_Queens_Deities_forSNA.csv (includes only those cases when a deity is attested in the same semantic context with a queen).

<b>Genre_Queens.csv:</b> Genre distribution of the queen texts in Texts_Queens_Deities_forSNA.csv.

<b>Queens_gender.csv:</b> List showing the gender of the deities co-occurring with queens.

<b>Queens_Texts_Oracc.csv:</b> A list of texts in Oracc (RIAo, RINAP, SAAo) which include at least one queen and one deity. In case of unnamed queens, we followed Svärd 2015 and included all the identifications she characterizes as certain or probable. Those identifications which Svärd classifies “possible” and those in which she lists several possible queens were left out.

<b>Texts_Queens_Deities.csv:</b> A list of queens and deities mentioned in the same semantic context in a text. This list was manually compiled on the basis of Queens_Texts_Oracc.csv and non-Oracc texts listed in Svärd 2015. If a deity is listed more than once on a row, the deity and the queen in question are mentioned several times in the same semantic context in that text. This file was used to produce Collocates_Queens.csv.
