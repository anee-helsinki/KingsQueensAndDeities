## Data used to create networks of queens and deities; and related lists

<b>Collocates_Queens.csv:</b> A list of pairs of queens and deities with the number of times they were mentioned together in Texts_Queens_Deities_forSNA.csv. This file was used to create the network of queens and deities.

<b>Frequencies_Deities_Q.tsv:</b> List of deities and their frequencies in the dataset on queens (includes only those cases when a deity is attested in the same semantic context with a queen).

<b>Genre_Queens.csv:</b> Genre distribution of the queen texts used for network analysis (Texts_Queens_Deities_forSNA.csv).

<b>Queens_Texts_Oracc.csv:</b> A list of texts in Oracc (RIAo, RINAP, SAAo) which include at least one queen and one deity. In case of unnamed queens, we followed Svärd 2015 and included all the identifications she characterizes as certain or probable. Those identifications which Svärd classifies “possible” and those in which she lists several possible queens were left out.

<b>Texts_Queens_Deities_forSNA.csv:</b> A list of queens and deities mentioned in the same semantic context in a text. This list was manually compiled on the basis of Queens_Texts_Oracc.csv and non-Oracc texts listed in Svärd 2015. If a deity is listed more than once on a line, the deity and a queen are mentioned several times in the same semantic context in that text. This file was used to produce Queens_SeveralIstar.csv.
