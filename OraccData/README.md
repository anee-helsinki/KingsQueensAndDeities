## The data extracted from Oracc

Texts and their metadata were downloaded as JSON files from Oracc and converted to simple .tsv files available in this folder. When we started data processing in February 2020, RINAP 2 project (the royal inscriptions of Sargon II) was not publicly available, but Jamie Novotny kindly provided us with a preliminary dataset (rinap-szar2gina2019). We thank him for making the files available to us. This folder contains only those 6141 texts that are dated to the kings under scrutiny in our research.
