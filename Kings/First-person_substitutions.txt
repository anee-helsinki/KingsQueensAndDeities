The rules for substituting the name of a king for certain first-person pronouns, verbal forms, and words having first-person endings in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions (RIAo, RIBo, and RINAP).

Verbs
- epos: V, transcription starting with "a"
- wclass: V, transliteration ending with "an-ni" 
 
Statives
- wclass: AJ or N, transcription ending with "āku", "āk", or "âku"
 
Pronouns
- lemmas "anāku", "yâti", "yâši", "yāši", "yâšim", "yû", and "yāʾu"
- wclass: N, transcription ending with "ya"


NOTES
- First and third person singular forms of verbs are identical in the D and Š stems. The differentiation could be done manually based on the context, but this is not doable because RINAP alone has 3,419 attestations of verbal forms starting with u-.
- Pronominal suffix -ī cannot be used automatically because it also marks plurals; the same applies to pronominal suffixes -a, -ni, -anni because many dictionary forms of words end in these letters.
