#Kings of interest in the RIAo project texts. For the article "The Relationships of Neo-Assyrian Kings and Queens to the Divine" we only used the texts that were in Oracc tagged as being written during the reign of these kings. Certain first person pronouns and verbal and nominal forms were replaced with the name of the "ruler" of the text.
