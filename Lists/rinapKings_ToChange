#Different ways of lemmatising kings' names have been normalised according to this list. The preferred normalization is on the left side of the equals signs and the variants on the right side. Shalmaneser V does not appear in the list because he is not attested with any deity in the available texts. Sîn-šumu-līšir and Aššur‐uballiṭ II have not left us any inscriptions.
